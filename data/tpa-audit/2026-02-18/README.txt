============================================

The attached file (db_content_audit.csv) is a full audit of all content in the
Payments Association WordPress database. Each row is a piece of content with a
recommended action in the audit_status column:

  DELETE_CANDIDATE  5,105 posts  —  Published more than 3 years ago and likely outdated
  REVIEW            1,025 posts  —  Drafts, private posts, or pending — needs a decision
  KEEP              3,124 posts  —  Published within the last 3 years, no action needed

Total content reviewed: 9,254 posts across articles, pages, whitepapers, webinars,
directories, events, toolkits, podcasts, and more.

Note: system records (tickets, orders, media files) are excluded — this covers
published content only.
